# Mathematical Functions in C++

## Overview
This project showcases the use of template functions and mathematical calculations in C++. It demonstrates the flexibility of templates by implementing functions that compare values and check if numbers are within a specified range.

## Features
- Template constant for π (`pi`), demonstrating how to define constants with generic types.
- Generic function `Greater_than` to compare two values of potentially different types.
- Function `inPiRange` to check if an integer value is less than π.

## Requirements
C++11 or later
g++ or another compatible C++ compiler

## Files Included
- MathFunctions.hpp: Header file with template definitions and function declarations.
- MathFunctions.cpp: (Contains minimal content, mainly the inclusion of MathFunctions.hpp).
- main.cpp: Main driver program that tests the functions defined in MathFunctions.hpp.
